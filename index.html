In this project, I implemented the UX code, consisting of a custom Table View with expandable cells, a custom Tab Bar with a content view, while using AutoLayout. Also, I initiated a major architectural change for the app, introduced tests and developed the Landing Page, while researching new features as one of the lead developers and co-founder. (Currently working on ongoing major architectural change)

  <code>Scarecrow</code> - Scarecrow is a device intended to help farmers with their work by monitoring the crop for pests and other issues. The project was one of the finalists for the SBESC 2017 (Brazilian Symposium on Computing Systems Engineering). A camera and a Raspberry Pi 3 attached with sensors would process images of plants and determine if there are plagues or not. This information would then be sent to our backend to the iOS client. I was responsible for helping with the Real-Time Clock Library of the OM2385/SF001 - OL2385 Wireless sub-GHz Transceiver SIGFOX Development Kit with KL43Z to activate the Raspberry Pi 3 regularly in C; the entire iOS application using the Clean Swift architecture, the backend of our server, and the entire connection between the two. Also responsible for the project's presentation (Slides and presenting) in English to judges in the SBESC 2017.
