      <code><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/ohana-family-together/id1242135997?mt=8">Ohana - Family Together</a></code> - iOS app which helps families to keep track of a relative who needs care by sharing their activities. In this project, I implemented the UX code, consisting of a custom Table View with expandable cells, a custom Tab Bar with a content view, while using AutoLayout. Also, I initiated a major architectural change for the app, introduced tests and developed the Landing Page, while researching new features as one of the lead developers and co-founder. (Currently working on ongoing major architectural change)

      <p>
  <code>Scarecrow</code> - Scarecrow is a device intended to help farmers with their work by monitoring the crop for pests and other issues. The project was one of the finalists for the SBESC 2017 (Brazilian Symposium on Computing Systems Engineering). A camera and a Raspberry Pi 3 attached with sensors would process images of plants and determine if there are plagues or not. This information would then be sent to our backend to the iOS client. I was responsible for helping with the Real-Time Clock Library of the OM2385/SF001 - OL2385 Wireless sub-GHz Transceiver SIGFOX Development Kit with KL43Z to activate the Raspberry Pi 3 regularly in C; the entire iOS application using the Clean Swift architecture, the backend of our server, and the entire connection between the two. Also responsible for the project's presentation (Slides and presenting) in English to judges in the SBESC 2017.

	  <code>SciFiller</code> - iOS App which lets you fill your spare time with science content that matches your taste. Implemented initial
	  layout, brought Progress bar, implemented video player, and fixed issues.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	  <code>Extinction Beat</code> - iOS Game App runner based on musics and different kinds of feedback to support people with hearing loss. Game made using
	 Sprite Kit, where I implemented the game interface, physics rule, and some external layout.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	  <code>Kakua</code> - iOS App focused on motivating the user to consume art in a therapeutic way, while being responsible for the growth of a cactus. The entire iOS
	app was made using Objective C, where I implemented a microphone ringer, the app model logic, the transition through screens, and a small backend client written in Node.js to update records into our CloudKit database using CloudKit JS served by Heroku. (Currently being worked on to be released in the App Store)
